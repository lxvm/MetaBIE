  abstract = {In this paper we consider the scattering of a plane acoustic or electromagnetic wave by a one-dimensional, periodic rough surface. We restrict the discussion to the case when the boundary is sound soft in the acoustic case, perfectly reflecting with TE polarization in the EM case, so that the total field vanishes on the boundary. We propose a uniquely solvable first kind integral equation formulation of the problem, which amounts to a requirement that the normal derivative of the Green's representation formula for the total field vanish on a horizontal line below the scattering surface. We then discuss the numerical solution by Galerkin's method of this (ill-posed) integral equation. We point out that, with two particular choices of the trial and test spaces, we recover the so-called SC (spectral-coordinate) and SS (spectral-spectral) numerical schemes of DeSanto et al., Waves Random Media, 8, 315-414, 1998. We next propose a new Galerkin scheme, a modification of the SS method that we term the SS{${_\ast}$} method, which is an instance of the well-known dual least squares Galerkin method. We show that the SS{${_\ast}$} method is always well-defined and is optimally convergent as the size of the approximation space increases. Moreover, we make a connection with the classical least squares method, in which the coefficients in the Rayleigh expansion of the solution are determined by enforcing the boundary condition in a least squares sense, pointing out that the linear system to be solved in the SS{${_\ast}$} method is identical to that in the least squares method. Using this connection we show that (reflecting the ill-posed nature of the integral equation solved) the condition number of the linear system in the SS{${_\ast}$} and least squares methods approaches infinity as the approximation space increases in size. We also provide theoretical error bounds on the condition number and on the errors induced in the numerical solution computed as a result of ill-conditioning. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the SS{${_\ast}$} method and illustrate the ill-conditioning that arises.},

For piecewise homogeneous materials, they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. They also satisfy the radiation condition for the scattered field, avoiding the need for artificial boundary conditions on a truncated computational domain. By using the quasi-periodic Green's function, appropriate boundary conditions are automatically satisfied on the boundary of the unit cell. There are two drawbacks to this approach: (i) the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for parameter families known as Wood's anomalies, even though the scattering problem remains well-posed, and (ii) the lattice sum representation of the quasi-periodic Green's function converges in a disc, becoming unwieldy when obstacles have high aspect ratio.},

The proposed method, which, for definiteness, is demonstrated here for arrays of perfectly conducting particles under transverse electric polarization, is based on the use of the shifted Green-function method introduced in a recent contribution (Bruno \& Delourme 2014 J.

As shown in this paper, these infinite terms can be treated via an application of ideas related to the Woodbury\textendash Sherman\textendash Morrison formulae. The resulting approach, which is applicable to general arrays of obstacles even at and around Wood-anomaly frequencies, exhibits fast convergence and high accuracies. For example, a few hundreds of milliseconds suffice for the proposed approach to evaluate solutions throughout the resonance region (wavelengths comparable to the period and cylinder sizes) with full single-precision accuracy.},

The WGF method, which is based on the use of smooth windowing functions and integral kernels that can be expressed directly in terms of the free-space Green function, does not require evaluation of expensive Sommerfeld integrals. The proposed approach is fast, accurate, flexible, and easy to implement. In particular, straightforward modifications of existing (accelerated or unaccelerated) integral-equation solvers suffice to incorporate the WGF capability. The method relies on a certain integral equation posed on the union of the boundary of the obstacle and a small flat section of the interface between the penetrable media. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that both the near- and far-field errors resulting from the proposed approach decrease faster than any negative power of the window size. In the examples considered in this paper the proposed method is up to thousands of times faster, for a given accuracy, than a corresponding method based on use of Sommerfeld integrals.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This thesis presents a full-spectrum, well-conditioned, Green-function methodology for evaluation of scattering by general periodic structures, which remains applicable on a set of challenging singular configurations, usually called Rayleigh-Wood (RW) anomalies, where most existing methods break down. After reviewing a variety of existing fast-converging numerical procedures commonly used to compute the classical quasi-periodic Green-function, the present work explores the difficulties they present around RW-anomalies and introduces the concept of hybrid "spatial/spectral" representations. Such expressions allow both the modification of existing methods to obtain convergence at RW-anomalies as well as the application of a slight generalization of the Woodbury-Sherman-Morrison formulae together with a limiting procedure to bypass the singularities. Although,  for definiteness, the overall approach is applied to the scalar (acoustic) wave-scattering problem in the frequency domain, the approach can be extended in a straightforward manner to the harmonic Maxwell's and elasticity equations. Ultimately, the thorough understanding of RW-anomalies this thesis provides yields fast and highly-accurate solvers, which are demonstrated with a variety of simulations of wave-scattering phenomena by arrays of particles, crossed impenetrable and penetrable diffraction gratings, and other related structures. In particular, the methods developed in this thesis can be used to "upgrade" classical approaches, resulting in algorithms that are applicable throughout the spectrum, and it provides new methods for cases where previous approaches are either costly or fail altogether. In particular, it is suggested that the proposed shifted Green function approach may provide the only viable alternative for treatment of three-dimensional high-frequency configurations. A variety of computational examples are presented which demonstrate the flexibility of the overall approach, including, in particular, a problem of diffraction by a double-helix structure, for which numerical simulations did not previously exist, and for which the scattering pattern presented in this thesis closely resembles those obtained in crystallography experiments for DNA molecules.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Only smooth boundaries are considered, but some of the techniques extend straightforwardly to the case of corners. Three are modifications of the global periodic trapezoid rule, due to Kapur-Rokhlin, to Alpert, and to Kress. The fourth is a modification to a quadrature based on Gauss-Legendre panels due to Kolm-Rokhlin; this formulation allows adaptivity. We compare in numerical experiments the convergence of the four schemes in various settings, including low- and high-frequency planar Helmholtz problems, and 3D axisymmetric Laplace problems. We also find striking differences in performance in an iterative setting. We summarize the relative advantages of the schemes.},

The practical application of these methods, however, requires the accurate evaluation of boundary integrals with singular, weakly singular or nearly singular kernels. Historically, these issues have been handled either by low-order product integration rules (computed semi-analytically), by singularity subtraction/cancellation, by kernel regularization and asymptotic analysis, or by the construction of special purpose ``generalized Gaussian quadrature'' rules. In this paper, we present a systematic, high-order approach that works for any singularity (including hypersingular kernels), based only on the assumption that the field induced by the integral operator is locally smooth when restricted to either the interior or the exterior. Discontinuities in the field across the boundary are permitted. The scheme, denoted QBX (quadrature by expansion), is easy to implement and compatible with fast hierarchical algorithms such as the fast multipole method.

Given a point source located in an unbounded half-space or an infinitely extended layer, Sommerfeld and others showed that Fourier analysis combined with contour integration provides a systematic and broadly effective approach, leading to what is generally referred to as the Sommerfeld integral representation. When either the source or target is at some distance from an infinite boundary, the number of degrees of freedom needed to resolve the scattering response is very modest. When both are near an interface, however, the Sommerfeld integral involves a very large range of integration and its direct application becomes unwieldy. Historically, three schemes have been employed to overcome this difficulty: the method of images, contour deformation, and asymptotic methods of various kinds. None of these methods make use of classical layer potentials in physical space, despite their advantages in terms of adaptive resolution and high-order accuracy. The reason for this is simple: layer potentials are impractical in layered media or half-space geometries since they require the discretization of an infinite boundary. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method which combines layer potentials (physical-space) on a finite portion of the interface together with a Sommerfeld-type (Fourier) correction. We prove that our method is efficient and rapidly convergent for arbitrarily located sources and targets, and show that the scheme is particularly effective when solving scattering problems for objects which are close to the half-space boundary or even embedded across a layered media interface.},

(Similar approximations are found in scalar diffraction theory and in ray optics for curved surfaces.) In this paper, we develop a precise theory of such approximations for variable-impedance surfaces. Not only do we obtain a type of adiabatic theorem showing that the \&\#x0201C;zeroth-order\&\#x0201D; locally uniform approximation converges in the limit as the surface varies more and more slowly, including a way to quantify the rate of convergence, but we also obtain an infinite series of higher-order corrections. These corrections, which can be computed to any desired order by performing integral operations on the surface fields, allow rapidly varying surfaces to be modeled with arbitrary accuracy, and also allow one to validate designs based on the zeroth-order approximation (which is often surprisingly accurate) without resorting to expensive brute-force Maxwell solvers. We show that our formulation works arbitrarily close to the surface, and can even compute coupling to guided modes, whereas in the far-field limit our zeroth-order result simplifies to an expression similar to what has been used by other authors.},

  abstract = {We present a "physics-enhanced deep-surrogate ("PEDS") approach towards developing fast surrogate models for complex physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) and similar models: we show how to combine a low-fidelity "coarse" solver with a neural network that generates "coarsified'' inputs, trained end-to-end to globally match the output of an expensive high-fidelity numerical solver. In this way, by incorporating limited physical knowledge in the form of the low-fidelity model, we find that a PEDS surrogate can be trained with at least \$\textbackslash sim 10\textbackslash times\$ less data than a "black-box'' neural network for the same accuracy. Asymptotically, PEDS appears to learn with a steeper power law than black-box surrogates, and benefits even further when combined with active learning. We demonstrate feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach by using an example problem in electromagnetic scattering that appears in the design of optical metamaterials.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet and impedance boundary value problems for the Helmholtz equation in a non-locally perturbed half-plane. These boundary value problems arise in a study of time-harmonic acoustic scattering of an incident field by a sound-soft, infinite rough surface where the total field vanishes (the Dirichlet problem) or by an infinite, impedance rough surface where the total field satisfies a homogeneous impedance condition (the impedance problem). We propose a new boundary integral equation formulation for the Dirichlet problem, utilizing a combined double- and single-layer potential and a Dirichlet half-plane Green's function. For the impedance problem we propose two boundary integral equation formulations, both using a half-plane impedance Green's function, the first derived from Green's representation theorem, and the second arising from seeking the solution as a single-layer potential. We show that all the integral equations proposed are uniquely solvable in the space of bounded and continuous functions for all wavenumbers. As an important corollary we prove that, for a variety of incident fields including an incident plane wave, the impedance boundary value problem for the scattered field has a unique solution under certain constraints on the boundary impedance.
