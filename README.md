# MetaBIE

This Julia package is a final project for MIT math's course 18.336.
A copy of the report is available [here](https://web.mit.edu/lxvm/www/posts/report_VanMunoz_Lorenzo.pdf)

## Build instructions

System requirements include `bash`, `julia` (preferrably the latest version), a
full TeX distribution (such as TeXLive), and `latexmk`. When these programs are
available on the `PATH`, run the `make.sh` script to generate the data, figures,
and final report, which should take around 10 minutes.
